2ver might
Swear to God
They could barely even see the dog
They don't see the size of the fight

Wake up
Drink water
Smoke blunt
Clean, oil my Kaliashnikov
Stockpile ten for me and friends in case shit get to poppin' off
The evening news givin' yous views
Telling you to pick your master for president
Then behind the curtain, seen the devil workin'
Came back with some evidence
I'm here to tell you don't let em tell you what's right wrong

Make love, smoke kush, fight, or laugh hard, and live long
That's the antidote
You defeat the devil when you hold onto hope
'Cause kinfolk life is beautiful
And we ain't gotta die for them other men
And I refuse to kill another human being
In the name of a government
'Cause I don't study war no more
I don't hate the poor no more
Gettin' more ain't what's more
Only thing more is the love
So when you see me, please greet me with a heart full
And a pound and a hug

Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me up, take me up, take me up
Take me up, take me up, take me up
Up, up, up
Up, up
Up, up, up, up, up, up

Seen the devil give a sermon in the church
Seen an angel dancing in the club
Tryin' to feed a baby so I threw a thousand in the air
And blessed her with a hug
I done been down so many times
Walked on like a dirty rug
And now that I made it, can't fake it
Gotta give me what I'm truly worthy of
(Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy)

And I don't how much it really means to be right (means to be right, means to be right)
And what a joy it'd be to see some peace in this life (peace in this life, peace in this life)
And it occurs to me that maybe we ain't ever really seen any right
Here in the dark
Hoping just to see a beam of the light (beam of the light, beam of the light)
Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me up, take me up, take me up
Take me up, take me up, take me up
